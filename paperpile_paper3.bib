              vehicle data) provide a promising foundation to improve the
              observability of travel demand dynamics. However, the raw
              trajectories are not always accurate and complete due to technical
              and privacy issues. This paper proposes a data-driven optimization
              modeling framework to reconstruct the location-duration-path
              choices for the missing observations from the incomplete
              trajectories. By processing many-day raw trajectories, we observe
              a set of historical choices of location-duration-path and identify
              missing observations in space and time dimensions. To improve
              computational efficiency, we apply data-driven network-time prisms
              that reduce the search space for the missing choices. Then, we
              formulate Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) models with
              likelihood bounds, a special case of data-driven optimization
              models using phi-divergences (i.e., χ2 distance), to reconstruct
              the missing choices. To solve the minimax programs of the DRO
              models while maintaining tractability, we reformulate and solve
              the equivalent dual problems of the DRO models based on the strong
              duality theory. To demonstrate and validate the proposed models,
              we use a real-world connected vehicle dataset containing around
              2,800 connected vehicles over two separate months in Southeast

               in many recent studies that have largely improved our
               understanding of human mobility. These data consist of
               time-stamped and geo-referenced communication events recorded by
               network operators, on a per-subscriber basis. They allow for
               unprecedented tracking of populations of millions of individuals
               over long periods that span months. Nevertheless, due to the
               uneven processes that govern mobile communications, the sampling
               of user locations provided by mobile phone data tends to be
               sparse and irregular in time, leading to substantial gaps in the
               resulting trajectory information. In this paper, we illustrate
               the severity of the problem through an empirical study of a
               large-scale Call Detail Records (CDR) dataset. We then propose
               Context-enhanced Trajectory Reconstruction, a new technique that
               hinges on tensor factorization as a core method to complete
               individual CDR-based trajectories. The proposed solution infers
               missing locations with a median displacement within two network
               cells from the actual position of the user, on an hourly basis
               and even when as little as 1\% of her original mobility is known.
               Our approach lets us revisit seminal works in the light of
               complete mobility data, unveiling potential biases that
               incomplete trajectories obtained from legacy CDR induce on key

               mobility research. Such efforts have led to many insights on the
               travel behavior and activity patterns of people. Despite these
               achievements, the data veracity issue and its impact on the
               processes of knowledge discovery have seldom been discussed. In
               this research, we investigate the veracity issue of mobile
               signaling data (MSD) when they are used to characterize human
               mobility patterns. We first discuss the location uncertainty
               issues in MSD that would hinder accurate estimations of human
               mobility patterns, followed by an examination of two existing
               methods for addressing these issues (clustering-based method and
               time window?based method). We then propose a new approach that
               can overcome some of the limitations of these two methods. By
               applying all three methods to a large-scale mobile signaling data
               set, we find that the choice of preprocessing methods could lead
               to changes in the data characteristics. Such changes, which are
               nontrivial, will further affect the characterization and
               interpretation of human mobility patterns. By computing four
               mobility indicators (number of origin?destination trips, number
               of activity locations, total stay time, and activity entropy)
               from the outputs of the three methods, we illustrate their
               varying impacts on individual mobility estimations relevant to
               location uncertainty issues. Our analysis results call for more

                 sampled from the Internet. The trajectory extraction procedure
                 is composed of three main parts: trajectory clustering,
                 trajectory cleaning and trajectory connecting. In the
                 clustering procedure, we focus on feature construction and
                 parameter selection for the fuzzy C-means clustering method.
                 Following the clustering procedure, the trajectory cleaning
                 algorithm is implemented based on a new introduced fuzzy
                 connecting matrix, which evaluates the possibility of data
                 belonging to the same trajectory and helps detect the anomalies
                 in a ranked context-related order. Finally, the trajectory
                 connecting algorithm is proposed to solve the issue that occurs
                 in some cases when a route trajectory is incorrectly
                 partitioned into several clusters. In the missing data recovery
                 procedure, we developed the contextual linear interpolation for

                 the median value interpolation for the cases of missing data
                 outside the trajectory. Extensive experiments are conducted to
                 demonstrate that the proposed framework offers a powerful

                 data with incompleteness may lead to a loss of power and
                 unreliable results, especially for large missing
                 subsequence(s). Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a new
                 approach for filling successive missing values in
                 low/uncorrelated multivariate time series which allows managing
                 a high level of uncertainty. In this way, we propose using a
                 novel fuzzy weighting-based similarity measure. The proposed
                 method involves three main steps. Firstly, for each incomplete
                 signal, the data before a gap and the data after this gap are
                 considered as two separated reference time series with their
                 respective query windowsQbandQa. We then find the most similar
                 subsequence (Qbs) to the subsequence before this gapQband the
                 most similar one (Qas) to the subsequence after the gapQa. To
                 find these similar windows, we build a new similarity measure
                 based on fuzzy grades of basic similarity measures and on fuzzy
                 logic rules. Finally, we fill in the gap with average values of
                 the window followingQbsand the one precedingQas. The
