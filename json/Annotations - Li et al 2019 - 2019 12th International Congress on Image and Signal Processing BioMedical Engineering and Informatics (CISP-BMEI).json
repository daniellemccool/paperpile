    "MarkupText": "when the number of missing data points is large, the extrapolation accuracy of the ARMA model is limited, and the compensation accuracy of the spline function is affected by the number of nodes and the boundary points, and the interpolation precision is also not high. Therefore, this paper proposes a trajectory missing data interpolation method based on bidirectional unequal interval kernel adaptive filtering.",

    "MarkupText": "The basic idea of the bidirectional prediction method is that the pair of the training samples is formed by the measured data before and after the missing data segment for the kernel adaptive filter. Point-by-point prediction of missing data from forward and reverse is performed using two kernel adaptive filters. In this way, no matter from the forward prediction or the backward prediction, the time span of the missing data is half of the entire missing data segment, so the accuracy of the predicted data point can be greatly improved.",
