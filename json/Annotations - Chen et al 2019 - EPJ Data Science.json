    "MarkupText": "Indeed, when extensive knowledge of the user mobility is required by the nature of the investigation, the straightforward way to deal with incomplete trajectory data is that of filtering users so as to exclude from the analysis those with insufficient location information. This is typically performed by imposing thresholds on the amount of mobility data available in CDR, though there is hardly a standard to define them. As a reference, several important works opt for a choice of users who have a minimum average sampling frequency of 0.5 events per hour, and who are observed at two unique locations at least [3, 4, 14]. User filtering comes with a cost in terms of below-threshold users that are excluded from the analysis. Unfortunately, in practical cases involving CDR datasets, even the loose requirements set by the thresholds mentioned above risk to lead to severe reductions in the examined user population. For instance, two very well-known studies analyze just 1.67% [3] and 0.45% [4] of the total subscribers available in their datasets upon filtering, leaving substantial richness in the original data untapped.",
