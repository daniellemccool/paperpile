    "MarkupText": "Haklay et al. (2010) investigated the positional accuracy for OpenStreetMap roads in the Greater London area. 109 different roads having a total length of 328[km] were compared to their counterpart in ITN (Integrated Transport Network) maps for which it can be assumed that the error is below 1 [m]. It is concluded that if 15 contributors are active in an area, the positional error for the road is well below 6 [m]. In complete areas the average error is 9.57 [m] with a standard deviation is 6.51 [m]. In incomplete areas the average error is 11.72 [m] and the standard deviation is 7.73 [m]. Completeness is defined as ‘a measure of the lack of data’ and examined for specific areas by Haklay (2010) using visual inspection of maps and by comparing (by means of GIS) the total road length found in OSM and in reference maps respectively.",

This includes estimating the effects on performance and accuracy of changes of the assumed global upper bound for the speed. 2. Investigation of the distribution for the results of behavior related scoring functions to the set of near MLH walks. 3. Determination and evaluation of a heuristic likelihood estimate that takes timing into account at a finer level. The current technique derives the link sequence order from topology and chronology but the GPS times are not used to determine consecutive positions on a single link. Extending the method in this way may solve the problem with single link trips mentioned in Section 5.1 item 2 but it may also improve the estimate of the likelihood and hence the accuracy of the method. 4. Computational performance for cases where the recording period is large needs to be increased.",
