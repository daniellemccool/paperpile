    "Text": "Paper discusses using fuzzy C-means clustering for evaluating the likelihood that various recorded trajectories were generated by the same underlying movement behavior. I imagine this fits into paper 3 when we evaluate filling gaps with a person's own data, but also in establishing how predictable a person's own behavior is as a metric for variance estimation. Can shed light (maybe) on between vs within person variation.",
