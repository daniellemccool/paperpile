The model uses a fully probabilistic process of generating an activity sequence to overcome the drawbacks of the deterministic estimation of human activity. An HMM and a VAE were incorporated into a single modeling framework such that the former generates activity sequences in a fully stochastic manner, and the latter moves the clustering y. An HMM and a VAE were incorporated into a single modeling framework such that the former generates activity sequences in a fully stochastic manner, and the latter moves the clustering task from an inconsistent observation space into a homogeneous latent space with a smaller dimension.
